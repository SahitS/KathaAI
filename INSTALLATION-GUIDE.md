## 🐍 Step 1: Install Python

### Option A: Download from Official Website (Recommended)

2. Download Python 3.8 or higher (latest version recommended)
3. **IMPORTANT**: During installation, check "Add Python to PATH"
4. Complete the installation

### Option B: Install from Microsoft Store
1. Open Microsoft Store
2. Search for "Python"
3. Install "Python 3.11" or latest version

## 📦 Step 2: Install AI Dependencies

After Python is installed, run these commands in Command Prompt or PowerShell:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd C:\Users\Sahit\Mythology-AI

# Install all required packages
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install transformers>=4.41
python -m pip install torch
python -m pip install fastapi
python -m pip install uvicorn
python -m pip install pydantic
python -m pip install argostranslate
python -m pip install sentencepiece
```

**OR** use the provided batch file:
```bash
install-ai-dependencies.bat
```

## 🚀 Step 3: Start AI Services

Once dependencies are installed, start the AI services:

```bash
start-ai-services.bat
```

This will start:
- **Chatbot API**: http://localhost:8000
- **Translation API**: http://localhost:8002  
- **Summarization API**: http://localhost:8001

## 🧪 Step 4: Test the Features

1. **Start Angular App**: `ng serve`
2. **Navigate to Mahabharatha**: Click on India → Explore
3. **Click on any verse** to open the detail modal
4. **Click "AI Help"** button to open the AI panel
5. **Test all three features**:
   - **AI Chatbot**: Ask questions about Mahabharata
   - **AI Translate**: Select language to translate verse
   - **AI Summarize**: Generate summary of the verse

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Python is not recognized:
1. Restart your computer after installing Python
2. Or manually add Python to PATH:
   - Search "Environment Variables" in Windows
   - Edit System Environment Variables
   - Add Python installation path to PATH

### If pip is not recognized:
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

### If models download slowly:
- First run may take 10-30 minutes to download AI models (2-4GB)
- Ensure stable internet connection
- Models are cached after first download

### If ports are busy:
- Close other applications using ports 8000, 8001, 8002
- Or modify port numbers in the batch files
